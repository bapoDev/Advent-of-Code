# Advent-of-Code :christmas_tree:

Welcome to the best AOC repo you're gonna find on Earth ! (no kidding)

If you want to participate before reading all this magnificent code, it's here : https://adventofcode.com/

> [!NOTE]
> Obviously, you're going to need an account but since you're on github looking at this, I assume you have a GitHub account, well that's cool you can use it to connect to the AOC website.

While I'm not trying to be very consistent or doing weird challenges like you can see on the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), I'll try to use a different language every day (I say try because 25 languages... oh boy... I only know Python, Java, Kotlin, JS pretty well, the rest is going to be some learning).

Each problem is available on the website and will not be copy pasted here, if you want to create an Issue, please try to search if it doesn't already exist, please do not publish the input that the AOC website has given you (as per the founder's instructions) and don't try to debug my code or anything, it's gonna stay as is on here once posted the first time. If you can't run my code, then maybe post an Issue, I will not accept merge requests or anything since this is obviously a personal project.

> [!TIP]
> Just a reminder that you can always use my code to debug yours by diffing the outputs you get, just don't say it's yours. It should be pretty easy to understand and edit. And if you're here to learn, obviously try to solve the problem by yourself, don't use my code to have a quick solution to get your stars, it will only make you less prone to finish your own projects if you just abandon. Of course, you do you, just a tip for beginners.
